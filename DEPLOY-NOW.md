# Deploy TrendScope Now - Quick Start Guide

This guide provides the simplest possible way to deploy TrendScope to Vercel. Follow these steps for a guaranteed successful deployment.

## Step 1: Deploy the Static Site

The `static-trendscope` directory contains a simple static HTML site that is guaranteed to deploy successfully on Vercel. This is the fastest way to get something live.

```bash
cd static-trendscope
vercel
```

When prompted, answer the questions as follows:
- Set up and deploy? **Yes**
- Which scope? **Your personal account**
- Link to existing project? **No**
- What's your project name? **trendscope**
- In which directory is your code located? **./** (current directory)

The deployment will complete in seconds, and you'll receive a URL where your site is live.

## Step 2: Deploy to Production (Optional)

If you're happy with the preview, deploy to production:

```bash
vercel --prod
```

## Step 3: Verify the Deployment

Visit the URL provided by Vercel to confirm that your site is live and working correctly.

## What's Next?

Once you have the static site deployed, you can:

1. **Gradually add more functionality** to the static site
2. **Create a simple Next.js application** without Python dependencies
3. **Follow the microservices architecture** in the `trendscope-deployment-guide.md` file to deploy the full application

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. **Try deploying through the Vercel dashboard**:
   - Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
   - Click "Add New..." > "Project"
   - Import your Git repository or upload the files directly
   - Select the `static-trendscope` directory as the root directory
   - Click "Deploy"

2. **Check for errors in the Vercel logs**:
   ```bash
   vercel logs trendscope
   ```

3. **Try a direct upload**:
   - Download the `static-trendscope` directory
   - Go to the Vercel dashboard
   - Click "Add New..." > "Project"
   - Choose "Upload" and select the `static-trendscope` directory
   - Click "Deploy"
