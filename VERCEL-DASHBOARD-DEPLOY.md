# Deploy TrendScope Using Vercel Dashboard

Since we're having issues with the CLI deployment, let's use the Vercel dashboard directly, which is often easier and more reliable.

## Step 1: Prepare Your Files

The `static-trendscope` directory contains a simple static HTML site that is guaranteed to deploy successfully on Vercel. Make sure these files are ready:
- `index.html` - The main HTML file
- `vercel.json` - Configuration for Vercel

## Step 2: Deploy Using Vercel Dashboard

1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and log in with your account
2. Click on "Add New..." > "Project" in the top right corner
3. Choose "Import Git Repository" or "Upload" (if you don't have a Git repository)
4. If uploading directly:
   - Click on "Upload" at the bottom of the page
   - Compress the `static-trendscope` directory into a ZIP file
   - Upload the ZIP file
5. Configure your project:
   - Project Name: `trendscope` (or any name you prefer)
   - Framework Preset: `Other`
   - Root Directory: Select the `static-trendscope` directory
6. Click "Deploy"

## Step 3: Verify the Deployment

Once the deployment is complete (usually within a minute), Vercel will provide you with a URL where your site is live. Click on the URL to verify that your site is working correctly.

## What's Next?

Once you have the static site deployed, you can:

1. **Gradually add more functionality** to the static site
2. **Create a simple Next.js application** without Python dependencies
3. **Follow the microservices architecture** in the `trendscope-deployment-guide.md` file to deploy the full application

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. **Check the deployment logs** in the Vercel dashboard
2. **Verify your files** are correct and properly formatted
3. **Try a different browser** if you're having issues with the Vercel dashboard
